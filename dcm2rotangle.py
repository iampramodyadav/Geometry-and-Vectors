    Converts a Direction Cosine Matrix (DCM) to Euler angles.

    Parameters:
        R (numpy.ndarray): 3x3 rotation matrix representing the DCM.
        sequence (str): String specifying the desired rotation sequence. Defaults to 'TXYZ'.
                        

    Returns:
        tuple: Tuple of three Euler angles (theta1, theta2, theta3) in radians.

    Notes:
        - The function uses the numpy library for array operations and trigonometric functions.
